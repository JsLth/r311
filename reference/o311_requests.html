    <h2 id="value">Value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#value"></a></h2>
    <p>A dataframe containing data on civic service requests. The
dataframe can contain varying columns depending on the open311
implementation.</p>

    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p><code>o311_request_all</code> applies a number of checks to determine when to
stop searching. First, many endpoints return an error if the last page
is exceeded. Thus, if the last page request failed, break.
Second, if exceeding the pagination limit does not return an error, the
response is compared with the previous response. If identical, the
response is discarded and all previous responses returned. Finally,
if the page exceeds <code>max_pages</code>, the responses up to this point are
returned.</p>
<p>open311 leaves space for endpoints to implement their own request
parameters. These parameters can be provided using dot arguments.
These arguments are not validated or pre-processed. Date-time objects
must be formatted according to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime" class="external-link">w3c</a> standard.
Some more common parameters include:</p>
<ul><li><p><code>q</code>: Perform a text search across all requests.</p></li>
<li><p><code>update_after</code>/<code>updated_before</code>: Limit request according
 to request update dates.</p></li>
<li><p><code>per_page</code>: Specifiy the maximum number of requests per page.</p></li>
<li><p><code>extensions</code>: Adds a nested attribute
 <code>"extended_attributes"</code> to the response.</p></li>
<li><p><code>long</code>/<code>lat</code>/<code>radius</code>: Searches for requests in a fixed radius
 around a coordinate.</p></li>
</ul><p>As dot arguments deviate from the open311 standard, they are not guaranteed
to be available for every endpoint and might be removed without further
notice. Refer to the endpoint docs to learn more about custom parameters
(<code>o311_endpoints()$docs</code>).</p>
